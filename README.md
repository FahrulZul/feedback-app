## Feedback app

This is a simple React app built for practicing feedback functionality that can be a part of another whole project. It allows users to input comments and give a rating on a scale of 1 to 10. Users can also delete and edit their comments. It's can be a great addition to any project that requires feedback functionality.

#### Running the app locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. The app will be running on http://localhost:3000.

#### Reference

-   I used the structure and some of the code logic from [Brad Traversy feedback-app](https://github.com/bradtraversy/feedback-app) repository in this project.
